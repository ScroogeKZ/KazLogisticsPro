## Overview

LogisticsPro is a comprehensive logistics management system built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application provides functionality for managing orders, inventory, routes, shipments, warehouse operations, invoices, and delivery cost calculations. It features a React-based frontend with TypeScript and a Node.js/Express backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence through Drizzle ORM.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **Development**: TSX for TypeScript execution in development

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Neon serverless driver)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Type Safety**: Drizzle-Zod for runtime validation and type inference

## Key Components

### Core Entities
1. **Orders**: Customer orders with items, delivery addresses, and status tracking
2. **Inventory**: Product catalog with stock levels and location tracking
3. **Routes**: Delivery route planning with driver assignments and vehicle tracking
4. **Shipments**: Shipment tracking with status updates and delivery confirmation
5. **Warehouse Operations**: Stock movements (inbound/outbound) with operator tracking
6. **Invoices**: Billing management with payment status tracking

### Business Logic Modules
- **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and KPI visualization
- **Cost Calculator**: Delivery cost estimation based on distance, weight, and fuel prices
- **Route Optimization**: Route planning and optimization tools
- **Inventory Management**: Stock level monitoring with low-stock alerts

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components use TanStack Query to fetch data from REST endpoints
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle HTTP requests and validate input using Zod schemas
3. **Data Access**: Storage layer abstracts database operations using Drizzle ORM
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL stores all application data with proper relationships and constraints
5. **Real-time Updates**: Query invalidation ensures UI reflects latest data changes

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL connection via Neon cloud platform
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing

### Development Tools
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development server
- **esbuild**: Fast bundling for production builds
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **vite**: Modern build tool with HMR

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (automatically provisioned)
- **Port Configuration**: Application serves on port 5000 (mapped to external port 80)
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with Replit integration

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Node.js server to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Assets**: Express serves built frontend from `dist/public`
- **Database**: Production uses same PostgreSQL connection via environment variables

### Replit Configuration
- **Modules**: nodejs-20, web, postgresql-16
- **Deployment**: Autoscale deployment target
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start`
